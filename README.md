 

# Hi there, I'm Hritik 👋

🚀 Persistent, pragmatic, and founder-minded — I love architecting reproducible, error-proof workflows for Kubernetes, CI/CD, and cloud-native development. My focus is on clarity, automation, and scaling developer experience.

## 🔥 Current Project: Streaming Service

I'm currently working on a **Streaming Service** that integrates seamlessly with cloud databases (Aiven MySQL) and Kubernetes deployments.
I'm currently developing a Streaming Service composed of multiple microservices that work together to deliver a seamless experience. Each microservice is designed with clear boundaries and responsibilities — from user authentication and content management to video delivery and notifications. The system integrates securely with cloud databases (Aiven MySQL) and runs on Kubernetes for scalability, resilience, and automated orchestration.

### ✨ Highlights
- **Secure Connectivity**: SSL/TLS enabled with mounted CA certificates.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with Kubernetes, leveraging ConfigMaps and Secrets for safe config management.
- **CI/CD Ready**: Pipelines designed for reproducible onboarding and error-proof secret handling.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Modular scripts and templates to simplify onboarding across environments.
